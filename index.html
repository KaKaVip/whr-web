					Waist–hip ratio or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W ÷ H). For example, a person with a 25″ (64 cm) waist and 38″ (97 cm) hips has a waist–hip ratio of about 0.66. <br> <br>The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and the risk of developing serious health conditions. WHR correlates with fertility (with different optimal values for males and females). <br>(wikipedia)

					Significance of the waist to hip ratio
				</h2>
				<h4 class="text-left  mg-sm tc-white">
					The waist to hip ratio, according to scientific studies, is a very effective indicator about the state of physical health of a person. The persons who have an "apple shaped" body with more fat at the waist are more prone to health risks than people with "pear shaped" bodies or who have less fat around their waist and more around their hips. Also according to a concept coined by Evolutionary physicist Devendra Singh at the University of Texas in 1993, physical attractiveness is related to the waist to hip ratio, especially so in the case of women. A waist to hip ratio of 0.7 is said to be ideal for women. In the case of men, 0.95 is considered to be an ideal value
